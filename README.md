# String Calculator TDD Kata (Dart)

This project is an implementation of the **String Calculator Kata** using
**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** in **Dart**.

The goal of this kata is to practice writing clean, incremental code by
starting with simple cases and gradually adding functionality through tests.

## 📌 Requirements Implemented

- Empty string returns `0`
- Single number returns its value
- Any amount of comma-separated numbers
- New lines between numbers are supported
- Custom delimiter support using `//[delimiter]\n`
- Throws exception for negative numbers
- Displays all negative numbers in the exception message

## 🧪 TDD Approach

Each feature was implemented using the following TDD cycle:

1. Write a failing test
2. Write the minimal code to pass the test
3. Refactor if needed
4. Commit the change

The Git history reflects this incremental approach.
